## Objectives

* Break a substitution cipher using frequency analysis and write the decryption function in Python
* Encrypt and decrypt using One-Time Pad (OTP)
* Compromise the integrity of a OTP-encrypted message (if knowing the plain text)

## Introduction

In this lab, you will be

* breaking a **substitution cipher** via frequency analysis. You are **not** allowed to use other methods to break the cipher. 
* manipulating an OTP encrypted message so that it decrypts to a message of your choosing

## Part I: Substitution Cipher

You are provided with a passage that is encrypted with a substition cipher. You only know a few things about it:

1. It is in "normal" English.
2. Spaces (" ") are preserved (the words are intact).
3. Punctuation may not be preserved.
4. It may consist of any characters included the `string.printable` set
5. You will recognise it when it is decrypted correctly.

The cipher text is provided in this folder (`story_cipher.txt`). 

Clues:

* [Wikipedia: Frequency analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis)
* [Hints for Frequency Analysis](http://www.thiagi.com/instructional-puzzles-original/2015/2/13/cryptograms)
* [The frequency of the letters of the alphabet in English Dictionary](https://www3.nd.edu/~busiforc/handouts/cryptography/letterfrequencies.html)
* [SAS: The frequency of letters in an English corpus](https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/2014/09/19/frequency-of-letters.html)

Practical hints:

* You can use Python's string `replace` function.
* If you are stuck halfway, visually inspect your current cipher, and see if you recognise any words that are only partially decrypted.
* Make sure you keep track of the replacements to ensure you do not "double replace". All the characters in the cipher are upper-case by design to make it easier for you. You can gradually replace them with your hypothesis of the correct lower-case characters and visually inspect the result.

Write a Python script to decrypt the cipher text, and submit it together with your decrypted plain text.

## Part II: Compromising OTP Integrity

In this section, we aim to change an encrypted message **without being able to decrypt it**. 

For example, we can change `Student ID 100XXXX gets a total of 0 points!` to any message of our choosing.

Your aim is to get change the **decrypted plain text response** to say you have gotten **4** points, without decrypting it yourself. 

For example, the text should say `Student ID 100XXXX gets a total of 4 points!` after decryption.

In other words, you manipulate the **cipher text** , so that it decrypts to a plain text of your choosing.

Thus, you are compromising the integrity of the encrypted message. 

Hints:

* The ciphertext is encrypted with a OTP. You do not know what the OTP is, it is randomly generated. 
* **You do not need to know anything about the OTP for this exercise.**

You are provided with `ex2.py` in this folder. Complete it to show that you can change the encrypted message without knowledge of the OTP.

## Submission

### eDimension Submission

Submission ground rules:

* Please make sure to indicate your name and student ID in each of the graded submission files

Lab 2 submission:

Upload a **zip file** with the following:

* `ex1.py`, your python script to perform decryption of the substitution cipher (`story_cipher.txt`)
* Decrypted plain text for Part I as `solution.txt`
* `ex2.py`, your python script to change the OTP message, you can based it on `ex2.py`
* Report is required

**You will not get the grade if your submission is not runnable.**
**Deadline: 3 June (2359)**
